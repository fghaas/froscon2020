## To summarize...

<!-- Note -->
So to summarize, here are my key points from this talk, in a nutshell
— please make this your key takeaways.


**Distributed teams are better than localized teams**

**— not because they’re distributed, but because they’re asynchronous.**


**Avoid anything that makes a distributed team run synchronously.**


**Use less chat.**


**Have fewer meetings.**


**Write. Things. Down.**
