## Video calls

(Zoom, Hangouts, BlueJeans etc.)

<!-- Note -->
Next, I’d like to talk about video calls. Doesn’t matter what
technology you’re using. Could be Zoom, Google Hangouts, BlueJeans,
Jitsi, whatever.

And I’d like to address this specifically, given the fact that in the
current pandemic the use of video calls appears to have skyrocketed.


#### Motivation for video calls <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

The only reason to use **video calls** is to be able  
to **pick up on nontextual and nonverbal cues.**

Seriously, that’s the **only** reason. <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

<!-- Note -->
There’s a very good reason to use video calls: they give you the
ability to pick up on nontextual and nonverbal cues from the call
participants. But that’s really the only good reason to use them.

Video calls have a significant drawback: until we get reliable
automatic speech recognition and transcription, they are only
half-on-the-record. Hardly anyone goes to the trouble of preparing a
full transcript of a meeting, and if anything, we get perhaps a
summary of points discussed and action items agreed to. So even if we
keep recordings of every video call we attend, it’s practically
impossible to discern, after the fact, what was discussed in a meeting
_before_ decisions were made.

It is also practically impossible to _find_ a discussion point that
you only have a vague recollection of when it was discussed in a video
call, whereas doing so has a much greater probability of success if
a discussion took place on any archived text-based medium.


#### Every video call needs an agenda.

<!-- Note -->
This is, of course, true for any meeting, not just those conducted by
video call.

A conversation without an agenda is useless. You want people to know
what to expect of the call. You also want to give people the option to
prepare for the call, such as doing some research or pulling together
some documentation. If you fail to circulate those *ahead of time,* I
can guarantee that the call will be ineffective, and will likely
result in a repeat performance.


#### Meeting notes <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

Until machines get intelligent enough to automatically transcribe and
summarise words spoken in a meeting, **write notes and a summary of
every meeting you attend,** and **circulate them.**

<!-- Note -->
Just as important as an agenda to set the *purpose* of the meeting, is
a set of notes that describes its *outcome*. 

Effective distributed teams understand that the *record* of a call is
what counts, not the call itself. It is not the spoken word that
matters, but the written one.

From that follows this consequence:


#### Meeting notes effort <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

To be useful, the write-up of a call **takes more time and effort**
than the call itself.

<!-- Note -->
If you think that video calls are any less work than chat meetings or
a shared document that’s being edited together or dicussed in
comments, think again. The only way a video call is less work, is when
everyone’s lazy and the call is, therefore, useless. Every meeting
needs notes and a summary, and you need to circulate these notes not
only with everyone who attended the meeting, but with everyone who has
a need-to-know.


#### Meeting notes contents <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

1. Meeting title
2. Date, time, attendees
3. Summary
4. Discussion points (tabular)
5. Action items

<!-- Note -->
Putting an executive summary at the very top is extraordinarily
helpful so people can decide if they

* should familiarise themselves with what was discussed, immediately,
  and possibly respond if they have objections, or
* only want to be aware of what was decided, or
* just keep in the back of their head that a meeting happened, that
  notes exist, and where they can find them when they need to refer
  back to them.


#### Meetings abolishing themselves <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

Once you do meetings right, you no longer need most of them.

<!-- Note -->
The funny thing is that once you adhere to this standard — and I
repeat, that is *the only acceptable standard* for video meetings –
you’ll note that you can actually skip the meeting altogether, use
*just* a collaboratively edited document *instead* of your meeting
notes, and remove your unnecessary synchronization point.


### Video calls for recurring team meetings

<!-- Note -->
There is one thing that I do believe video calls are good for, and
that is to use them for *recurring* meetings as as an
opportunity to feel the pulse of your team.

Obviously, a distributed team has *few* recurring meetings, because
they are synchronization points, and we’ve already discussed that we
strive to minimize those. So the idea of having daily standups, sprint
planning meetings, and sprint retrospectives is fundamentally
incompatible with distributed teams. *Aside: in my humble opinion,
this is also why using Scrum is a terrible idea in distributed teams —
not to mention [that it’s a terrible idea,
period.](https://youtu.be/f-ULT_Ic4qk)*

However, having perhaps one meeting per week (or maybe even one every
two weeks) in a video call is useful *precisely for the aforementioned
reasons* of being able to pick up on nonverbal clues like body
language, posture, facial expressions, and tone. If people are
stressed out or unhappy, it’ll show. If they are relaxed and
productive, that will show too.

Note that these meetings, which of course do follow the same rules
about agenda and notes, are not strictly *necessary* to get the work
done. The team I run has one one-hour meeting a week, but whenever
that meeting conflicts with anything we skip it and divide up our
work via just the circulated coordination notes, and that works
too. The meeting really serves the purpose of syncing emotionally, and
picking up on nonverbal communications.
