A distributed team is a **professional** group whose members do not
rely on physical proximity in order to **routinely** collaborate
productively.

<!-- Note -->

Now this is clearly not an ideal definition, not least because it
defines something by a negative, and an outside factor to boot: it
defines a distributed team by what it *does not need* to exist to
function. But it’s the best definition I’ve been able to come up with.

Now there’s a couple of key words in here:

* **Professional.** I’m talking about teams that work towards a
  professional goal. This doesn’t necessarily mean that they all work
  in the same company. They could, for example, all work in different
  companies collaborating on a joint project, which is what frequently
  happens in open source software projects. But they’re not pursuing
  their hobby, they’re doing their jobs.

* **Routinely.** I’m talking about teams that *habitually* work in a
  distributed fashion, not the work that goes on in an office-based
  team when one person is having a work-from-home day.

It is important to understand that that lack of proximity is not only
spatial, it is temporal as well, because:


Working in a distributed team means **working asynchronously.**

<!-- Note -->
If your team is distributed, this is equivalent to saying that it
works in an asynchronous fashion, that is to say, that people will
work on things in parallel, and a capable distributed team will have
just as few synchronization points as absolutely necessary.

The reason for this is not just working in different timezones, but
also the fact that everyone will have their own daily routine, and/or
have their individual times when they are most productive. Which you
*will not attempt to synchronize.* (Doing so would mean setting the
entire team up for failure.)

Now, this doesn’t come for free, nor does it fall in our lap:


Being productive in a distributed team is a skill  
that most people must **learn;** it is not innate to us.

<!-- Note -->
People are not born with the ability to work in a distributed
team. Humans function best in groups that collaborate in close
proximity to one another; it is only very recently that technology has
started to enable us to override that to an extent — giving us other
benefits like the ability to work from home, or the ability to hire
people residing anywhere, provided they have internet connectivity.

So we now *can* work in teams despite being continental distances away
from each other but we do have to acquire the skills to do that. And
if we fail to do so, that has a rather grave disadvantage, which is
that...


**Nothing** has as dire an impact on productivity as **poor
communications.**

<!-- Note -->
This is a truism that applies to both distributed and non-distributed
teams. Having bad communications will wreck any project, blow any
budget, fail any objective. Now note that the reverse is *not true:*
having *good* communications does not guarantee success. But having
bad communications does guarantee failure.

And here is one thing to start with:


A capable distributed team **habitually externalises** information.

<!-- Note -->
Information is generally far less useful when it is only stored in one
person’s head, as opposed to being accessible in a shared system that
everyone trusts and can use. If you take important information out of
your own head and store it in a medium that allows others to easily
find and contextualise it, that’s a win for everyone.

And since we’re all technology people, we typically have multiple
facilities to externalise, share, and then access information at our
disposal. So let’s see how those compare.

| -----------   | :---: | :--: |               |

The only reason to use **chat** for collaboration  
is a need for **immediate, interactive mutual feedback.**

<!-- Note -->
Using interactive chat is a positively nonsensical idea for any kind
of communications _except_ the kind that requires immediate,
interactive mutual feedback from two or more participants.

This means that the only thing that chat is good for is communication
that is required to be *synchronous,* and remember, in a distributed
team *asychronicity* is the norm. So using interactive chat for
communications needs to be an *exceptional* event for a distributed
team; if it is instead a regular occurrence you’ll make everyone on
the team miserable.

For any interaction that does *not* require feedback that is *both*
immediate and interactive, email, a wiki, or an issue tracker are *far
superior* modes of communication.


The only reason to use **direct messages** for collaboration  
is a need for immediate, interactive mutual feedback  
**and confidentiality.**

<!-- Note -->
Using chat DMs as the *default* means of communication is utterly
braindead. In order for a chat DM to be useful, there is precisely one
clearly delineated confluence of events that must occur:

* You need immediate feedback from the other person,
* you need mutual back-and-forth with the other person,
* you don’t want others to follow the conversation.

I can’t emphasize enough that this combination is perfectly valid —
but it is *exceedingly rare.* If you want just a private exchange of
ideas with someone, encrypted email will do. If you want to work on
something together with one person before you share it with others,
restricted view permissions on a wiki page or an issue tracker ticket
will work just fine.

If you don’t need confidentiality but you do need interactive and
immediate feedback, chances are that you’re working on something
urgent, and it is far more likely you’ll eventually need to poll other
opinions, than that you won’t. So just use a shared channel from the
get-go, that way it’s easier for others to follow the conversation if
needed — and they might be able to point out an incorrect assumption
that one of you has, before you end up chasing a red herring.


The only reason to use **video calls** is to be able  
to **pick up on nontextual and nonverbal cues.**

<!-- Note -->
Video calls have a significant drawback: until we get reliable
automatic speech recognition and transcription, they are only
half-on-the-record. Hardly anyone goes to the trouble of preparing a
full transcript of a meeting, and if anything, we get perhaps a
summary of points discussed and action items agreed to. So even if we
keep recordings of every video call we attend, it’s practically
impossible to discern, after the fact, what was discussed in a meeting
_before_ decisions were made.

It is also practically impossible to _find_ a discussion point that
you only have a vague recollection of when it was discussed in a video
call, whereas doing so has a much greater probability of success if
a discussion took place on any archived text-based medium.


**Every video call needs an agenda.**

<!-- Note -->
This is, of course, true for any meeting, not just those conducted by
video call.


Until machines get intelligent enough to automatically transcribe and
summarise words spoken in a meeting, **write notes and a summary of
every meeting you attend,** and **circulate them.**

<!-- Note -->
If you think that video calls are any less work than chat meetings or
a shared document that’s being edited together or dicussed in
comments, think again. The only way a video call is less work, is when
everyone’s lazy and the call is, therefore, useless. Every meeting
needs notes and a summary, and you need to circulate these notes not
only with everyone who attended the meeting, but with everyone who has
a need-to-know.


1. Meeting title
2. Date, time, attendees
3. Summary
4. Discussion points (tabular)
5. Action items

<!-- Note -->

Putting an executive summary at the very top is extraordinarily
helpful so people can decide if they

* should familiarise themselves with what was discussed, immediately,
  and possibly respond if they have objections, or
* only want to be aware of what was decided, or
* just keep in the back of their head that a meeting happened, that
  notes exist, and where they can find them when they need to refer
  back to them.


Whenever you need to thoroughly **brief a group of people on an
important matter,** consider using a **5-paragraph format.**


1. Situation
2. Mission
3. Execution
4. Logistics
5. Command and Signal

<!-- Note -->
This is a format as it is being used by many armed forces; in NATO
parlance it’s called the 5-paragraph field order. Now I’m generally
not a fan of applying military thinking to civilian life — after all
we shouldn’t forget that the military is an institution that kills
people and breaks things, and I say that as a commissioned officer in
my own country’s army —, but in this case it’s actually something that
can very much be applied to professional communications, with some
rather minor modifications. 


1. Situation
2. Objective
3. Plan
4. Logistics
5. Communications

<!-- Note -->

1. Situation is about what position we’re in, and **why** we set out
   to do what we want to do. You can break this down into three
   sub-points, like the customer’s situation, the situation of your
   own company, any extra help that is available, and the current
   market.
2. Objective is **what** we want to achieve.
3. Plan is **how** we want to achieve it.
4. Logistics is about what budget and resources are avaiable, and how
   they are used.
5. Communications is about how you’ll be coordinating among yourselves
   and with others in order to achieve your goal.


“Please come back to me with your questions by 1500 UTC tomorrow”  
is **far superior** to  
“are there any questions?”


The **amount of incoming information** in a distributed team  
can be **daunting.**


Consider using the **“four-D” approach**  
when dealing with incoming information.

(Hat tip to David Allen)


* Drop
* Delegate
* Defer
* Do

<!-- Note -->
* **Drop** means read, understand, and then archive. It’s what you use
  for anything that doesn’t require any action on your part.
* **Delegate** is for things that do require action, but not from
  you. Make sure that it gets to the right person and is understood by
  *them*, and make a note for follow-up.
* **Defer** means it needs doing, and it’s you who needs to do it, but
  it doesn’t need doing *immediately*. Enter it into your task list
  (to use a very generic term, more on this in a bit), and clear it
  from your inbox.
* **Do** are the (typically very few) things that remain that need to
  be done *by you, and immediately.*

Following this approach does not mean that you’ll never be overwhelmed
by the amount of information that you need to process. But it’ll
greatly reduce that risk.


Tasks without follow-up and follow-through are a waste of people’s
time.
