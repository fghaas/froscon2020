A distributed team is a **professional** group whose members do not
rely on physical proximity in order to **routinely** collaborate
productively.

<!-- Note -->

Now this is clearly not an ideal definition, not least because it
defines something by a negative, and an outside factor to boot: it
defines a distributed team by what it *does not need* to exist to
function. But it’s the best definition I’ve been able to come up with.

Now there’s a couple of key words in here:

* **Professional.** I’m talking about teams that work towards a
  professional goal. This doesn’t necessarily mean that they all work
  in the same company. They could, for example, all work in different
  companies collaborating on a joint project, which is what frequently
  happens in open source software projects. But they’re not pursuing
  their hobby, they’re doing their jobs.

* **Routinely.** I’m talking about teams that *habitually* work in a
  distributed fashion, not the work that goes on in an office-based
  team when one person is having a work-from-home day.

It is important to understand that that lack of proximity is not only
spatial, it is temporal as well, because:


Working in a distributed team means **working asynchronously.**

<!-- Note -->
If your team is distributed, this is equivalent to saying that it
works in an asynchronous fashion, that is to say, that people will
work on things in parallel, and a capable distributed team will have
just as few synchronization points as absolutely necessary.

The reason for this is not just working in different timezones, but
also the fact that everyone will have their own daily routine, and/or
have their individual times when they are most productive. Which you
*will not attempt to synchronize.* (Doing so would mean setting the
entire team up for failure.)

Now, this doesn’t come for free, nor does it fall in our lap:


Being productive in a distributed team is a skill  
that most people must **learn;** it is not innate to us.

<!-- Note -->
People are not born with the ability to work in a distributed
team. Humans function best in groups that collaborate in close
proximity to one another; it is only very recently that technology has
started to enable us to override that to an extent — giving us other
benefits like the ability to work from home, or the ability to hire
people residing anywhere, provided they have internet connectivity.

So we now *can* work in teams despite being continental distances away
from each other but we do have to acquire the skills to do that. And
if we fail to do so, that has a rather grave disadvantage, which is
that...


**Nothing** has as dire an impact on productivity as **poor
communications.**

<!-- Note -->
This is a truism that applies to both distributed and non-distributed
teams. Having bad communications will wreck any project, blow any
budget, fail any objective. Now note that the reverse is *not true:*
having *good* communications does not guarantee success. But having
bad communications does guarantee failure.

And here is one thing to start with:


A capable distributed team **habitually externalises** information.

<!-- Note -->
Information is generally far less useful when it is only stored in one
person’s head, as opposed to being accessible in a shared system that
everyone trusts and can use. If you take important information out of
your own head and store it in a medium that allows others to easily
find and contextualise it, that’s a win for everyone.

And since we’re all technology people, we typically have multiple
facilities to externalise, share, and then access information at our
disposal. So let’s see how those compare.
