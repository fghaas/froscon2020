### Why am I talking here?

office dweller — 11 years <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

distributed company founder — 6 years <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

remote exec leading distributed team in mixed-mode company — 2 years <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

So, why am I talking about **that**?

Or rather more precisely, why am **I** talking about that?

I turned 40 this year, have been in IT for about 19 years now (18
full-time), and out of that I have worked

* in 4 successive companies, all of which worked out of offices,
  for 11 years, 

* in a completely distributed company, that I founded, for 6 years,

* and now, for about two years, I run a distributed team that
  is a business unit of a company that has existed for 15 years and
  throughout that time, has only ever worked from a single office.

So I think I might have seen and been aware of some of the rather
interesting challenges that come with this. But I'd like to state one
thing upfront.

Nothing of what I am talking about is steeped in any scientific
rigour. I present anecdotes, not evidence. I might be mistaking
correlation for causation, or the other way round. It’s solely based
on my personal experience, and the experience of others I have talked
to, watched, or read. Everything I say here is subject to debate and
rebuttal, or you can simply have a different opinion.

But it’s definitely **not** science.

Now with all of that said, let me attempt to give a definition of a
distributed team, according to my understanding:
