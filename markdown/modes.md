## Modes of communication in distributed teams

<!-- Note -->
A distributed team will habitually use multiple modes of
communication, relying mostly on those that make sharing, finding, and
contextualising information easy, and avoiding those that make it
difficult.

In many teams, distributed or not, using chat as a default mode of
communication is becoming the norm. Now with an important exception,
which I’ll get to near the end of the talk, this is **not** a symptom
of having a particularly dynamic or efficient team; it’s the opposite.


### Excessively using chat isn’t being efficient.
It’s being lazy.

<!-- Note -->
It’s a symptom of the worst kind of laziness _(not malice!)_: in an
attempt to communicate quickly and easily, for yourself, you are really
making things harder for everyone, including yourself.


### Modes of communication: chat <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

|               | Share | Find | Contextualise |
| -----------   | :---: | :--: |               |
| Chat          | 🙂    | 😐   | 🙁            |

<!-- Note -->
This is because, while *sharing* information in a chat is extremely
easy, it is also a “fire and forget” mode of communications. Chat
makes it difficult to find information after the fact. If you’ve ever
attempted to scour a busy Slack or IRC archive for a discussion on a
specific topic that you only remember to have happened a “few months
ago”, you’ll agree with me here.

It’s even *more* difficult to read a Slack discussion in context, that
is to say in relation to *other* discussions on the same topic, days
or weeks earlier or later.

Let’s compare that to other communication modes:


### Modes of communication: email <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

|               | Share | Find | Contextualise |
| -----------   | :---: | :--: |               |
| Chat          | 🙂    | 😐   | 🙁            |
| Email         | 😐    | 😐   | 😐            |

<!-- Note -->
* Email makes it easy to share information with a person or a group
  from the get-go, but quite difficult to loop people into an ongoing
  discussion after the fact. Finding information later is just as hard
  as with chat, and it’s marginally better at contextualizing
  information than chat (because you get proper threading).


### Modes of communication: wiki, issue tracker <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

|               | Share | Find | Contextualise |
| -----------   | :---: | :--: |               |
| Chat          | 🙂    | 😐   | 🙁            |
| Email         | 😐    | 😐   | 😐            |
| Wiki          | 🙂    | 🙂   | 🙂            |
| Issue tracker | 🙂    | 🙂   | 🙂            |

<!-- Note -->
* A wiki and an issue tracker (provided you don’t lock them down with
  silly view permissions), in contrast, both make it *very* easy to
  share, find, **and** contextualise information.
  
  Note that “wiki”, in this context, is shorthand for any facility
  that allows you to collaboratively edit long-form documents
  online. That can be an actual wiki like a MediaWiki, but also
  something like Confluence, or even shared Google Docs.
  
  Likewise, “issue tracker” can mean RT, OTRS, Jira, Taiga, Bugzilla,
  whatever works for you.


### Modes of communication: video calls <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

|               | Share | Find | Contextualise |
| -----------   | :---: | :--: |               |
| Chat          | 🙂    | 😐   | 🙁            |
| Email         | 😐    | 😐   | 😐            |
| Wiki          | 🙂    | 🙂   | 🙂            |
| Issue tracker | 🙂    | 🙂   | 🙂            |
| Video call    | 😐    | 🙁   | 🙁            |

<!-- Note -->
* Video calls are even worse than chat or email, because sharing
  information works but doesn’t scale — you can’t reasonably have more
  than 5-or-so people in a video call, and sharing the recording of a
  full video call is just pointless.

So really, make your wiki and your issue tracker your default mode of
communications, and use the others sparingly. (This isn’t meant to be
a euphemism for “don’t use them”, as we’ll get to in a moment.)
